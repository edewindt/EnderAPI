# The Ender API

## Description

This was a passion project for my favorite series of books aswell as my favorite movie of all time by my favorite author Orson Scott Card. The swagger middleware is used to document the API.

This is a very simple API that sends back data for characters, armies, and species in the Enderverse.

Thank you for taking the time to check out this project, please let me know your thoughts. Or let me know if you have any questions.
